/*

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

✅ String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
✅ int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
✅ float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
✅ char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
✅ boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20
System.out.println(myNum);


final int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
