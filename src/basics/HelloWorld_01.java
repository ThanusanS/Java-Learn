class HelloWorld_01 {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.print("Hello world java learn");
    }
}

// The main() method is required in every Java program. It is where the program starts running:

// Any code placed inside the main() method will be executed. For now, you don't need to understand the keywords public, static, and void. You will learn about them later in this tutorial. Just remember: main() is the starting point of every Java program.





/* 

Note: The curly braces {} mark the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System.out.println() may look long, but you can think of it as a single command that means: "Send this text to the screen."

Here's what each part means (you will learn the details later):

System is a built-in Java class.
out is a member of System, short for "output".
println() is a method, short for "print line".
Finally, remember that each Java statement must end with a semicolon (;).
